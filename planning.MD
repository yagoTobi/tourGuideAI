### Claude Recommended Steps: 
+ Start with the conceptualization. Write down your app's purpose, features, and target audience.

**App's purpose:** 

To provide an instant, personalized, and engaging tour guide experience for travelers and locals, leveraging AI to deliver age-relevant historical and cultural information about their current location.

2. Interactive Map:
+ Display user's current location
+ Show nearby points of interest
+ Allow selection of points of interest for more information

3. Audio Guide:
+ Text-to-speech functionality for hands-free exploration
+ Background audio playback while using other apps 
+ Should be multi-lingual for sure too

4. User Accounts: 
+ User registration and login 
+ Save and view past trips and favourites

5. Recommendations: 
+ AI-powered suggestions for next locations to visit based on user preferences and current location 

6. Offline Mode

### Secondary Features (For future development):

1. Social Sharing: Allow users to share interesting facts or locations with friends

2. Gamification: Achievements or points for visitng locations 

3. Custom tours


+ Spend some time on UX design. Create simple user journeys on paper.
+ Move to Figma for UI design. Create your app's screens, focusing on layout and functionality rather than intricate designs initially.
+ Use Figma's prototyping features to create a clickable prototype.
+ Plan your React Native app structure. Decide on your folder structure, how you'll manage state, etc.
+ Start coding, beginning with a basic app structure and then adding features one by one.
+ As you develop, learn about and implement testing practices.
Research the deployment process for React Native apps.
